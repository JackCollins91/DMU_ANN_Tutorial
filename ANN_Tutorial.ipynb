    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are ANNs?\n",
    "Even if you have no familiarity with the theory, you can still follow this tutorial, just review the following key points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Artificial Neural Network is a type of supervised machine learner. It is trained on data and can then be used to make predictions about new data. In this tutorial, we will train an ANN to classify species of flowers based on measurements of their petals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this tutorial, we introduce the simplest kind of ANN, a 'Feed Forward Neural Network' (FNN), also known as a 'Multilayer Perceptron' (MLP). There are many more complex types of ANN which are better-suited to more complex tasks, like time-series prediction (with Recurrent Neural Networks) and Image Processing (with Convolutional Neural Networks). These are great techniques to learn, and this tutorial offers a solid basis from which to continue learning about those elsewhere. In fact, you may even reuse the same code with minor adjustments to perform those exact techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This tutorial is about stepping the reader through an example, and not about explaining what ANNs are. However, if you want to understand the theory, there are many resources available: We suggest [this video series ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) for an introduction to the theory of ANNs. If you want a very detailed understanding and are willing to purchase it, we can also recommend this excellent [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-tensorflow-2/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, here's a brief description of an FNN: An FNN is composed of computational units called 'neurons' which are grouped in sets called 'layers.' The inputs from the independent features are passed through the layers of neurons. The neurons fit weights to the inputs in a way that derives connections between the independent features and the dependant variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While ANNs are very well-suited for certain machine learning problems, in many scenarios simpler models, like logistic regression, may actually be better than ANNs. We'll explain this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are ANNs useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs excel at non-linearly separable problems. In the following figure, we can see an example of a non-linearly separable problem compared to one that is linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "![linear-problems alt ><](fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a linear problem, you can see how it would be possible to draw a line (straight or curvy) between the blue and red dots. This means we could derive a linear function (or a polynomial function) which takes the X and Y coordinates and outputs a classification for whether the dot is blue or red. But in the non-linear problem, there is no way a line (no matter how curvy) can separate the blue and red dots. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions which underpins ANNs allows for interactions between variables. This means the underlying function can fit to the X and Y inputs such that a dot is classified blue if the X coordinate is of a certain value AND the Y coordinates are within a certain range also. This innovation means that ANNs can fit to types of problems that are impossible for linear models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, ANNs are not always best. Because ANNs can fit so finely to data, it is vulnerable to overfitting. When a problem is linearly separable, it may often be better to use the simpler, and less overfit-prone model instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those readers familiar with tree-based models might recognize that tree algorithms can also handle interactions between features. It is true that tree-based models are also good for non-linearly separable problems as well as ANNs. Tree-based models partition a feature space, such as the X and Y coordinate space in the diagram above, into subsections and classify points based on which subsection they fall into. A key difference betweens ANNs and trees, is that while tree-based models usually have distinct boundaries between subsections (a result of the binary decision functions in the trees), ANNs are better suited to yield varying probabilities for classification classes across the space. This is not to say tree-based models do not output probabilistic predictions (they do), just that ANNs can be better suited to finely tune those probabilities. See [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/when-and-why-tree-based-models-often-outperform-neural-networks-ceba9ecd0fd8#:~:text=The%20primary%20difference%20in%20usage,power%20of%20tree%2Dbased%20methods.) for a deeper discussion of the differences between tree-based models and neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will step through an example from which you can reuse this code in your own project. We will demonstrate how to use Keras and Tensorflow, together, this is the most common starting point for learning neural networks. Before we begin, here's a quick introduction to these two packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Tensorflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/about#:~:text=TensorFlow%20gives%20you%20the%20flexibility,fast%20debugging%2C%20use%20eager%20execution.) is one of [the most popular](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/11/27/tensorflow-turns-5five-reasons-why-it-is-the-most-popular-ml-framework/) tools for developing neural networks. Tensorflow is not a library for making neural networks per se. Rather, Tensorflow is for efficiently handling the mathematic operations that neural networks rely on. ANNs utilize a lot of linear algebra, matrix operations and node-edge graph manipulations. Tensorflow provides a set of functionality to accomplish these operations efficiently with C++ code and allows the developer to use these functions with a python interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Keras?\n",
    "As discussed, Tensorflow itself doesn't directly provide neural network functionality. Instead, the programmer who wants to develop an ANN will need another library. [Keras](https://keras.io/why_keras/#:~:text=Keras%20prioritizes%20developer%20experience&text=Keras%20follows%20best%20practices%20for,learn%20and%20easy%20to%20use.) provides programmers a way to declare what kind of ANN they want and then Keras accomplishes the interfacing with Tensorflow to generate the network. Tensorflow focusses on accomplishing the mathematics efficiently, while Keras provides programmers an easy way to develop their models. \n",
    "Although Keras and Tensorflow are very often used together, they are actually independent. Keras can be used to interface with an alternative to Tensorflow, like Theano. Similarly, developers can use an alternatives to Keras, like TFLearn and still use Tensorflow in the backend. "

    "\n",
    "Firstly, we instantiate an empty 'sequential' model, so-called because each layer of neurons (which we shall add shortly) will feed into the subsequent layer (hence why this is also called a 'Feed Forward' network).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must populate our empty Sequential model with layers. Here we will use 'Dense' layers, which are simply arrays of neurons. This is the most basic type of neural network layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the Dense layer, we add a 'Dropout' layer. The Dropout layer is like a gatekeeper: it selects certain neurons in the previous layer and blocks its input from going to the next layer. This nullification is helpful for avoiding overfitting caused by neurons over-weighting certain signals in the data. Dropout layers use a fitting process to determine which neurons are the best to 'drop' to improve predictive performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we add the output layer. The shape of the output layer is important because it determines the format of the predictions. Because we have three classes in our classification problem, we want three outputs: each one will yield a float which represents the probability that a given case is of the corresponding species. \n",
    "If this were a regression problem, or a binary regression problem, we might only want one output unit, which would output just the regression value, or the probability of the binary case being a positive. "

    "- Epochs: The number of times the ANN shall repeatedly use the training data to find the optimum set of weights. \n",
    "A large number of epochs may increase accuracy, but takes longer to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizer: In the fitting process, random weights and thresholds are trialed for every node and the best combination is selected. However, trying every possible random combination is very inefficient. Instead, optimizers apply algorithms that aim to discover which combinations of parameters for each node is best. Instead of randomly selecting weights, the optimizer applies a guided process to discovering the best settings. These algorithms for determining the optimum weights are called 'gradient descent' algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning rate: The incremental value by which the optimizer varies weights.  A larger learning rate may be quicker to compute, but less accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loss Function: During the fitting process, the loss function is how we calculate if a given trial was better or worse that others. Here we use 'Binary Cross Entropy' which is a common selection for classification problems. Mean-squared error would be an appropriate choice for regression problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Metrics: Machine learning practitioners know there are many ways to evaluate a model's performance. We can record multiple metrics to evaluate performance. For example, we can examine the model's accuracy (the portion of correct predictions) and the recall (the portion of correctly classified cases of a given class among all cases of that class). "

    "From the code above, we are constructing an ANN like the one in this diagram. We have four features in our data, and so we have four input nodes to receive each value. If you know the theory of ANNs, you know that each node will apply a weight and an activation function to the input to determine the number it will output to every node in the next layer. However, we use a dropout layer, which will select some nodes to nullify. We have two such layers. Finally, we have three output nodes, representing the probability that the given case is of a certain species. Therefore, for each case we predict, we output three numbers. We conclude that whichever of those three numbers is largest corresponds to the most likely species for the given case. \n",

    "- Objective: One of the metrics. The 'best' model is the one with the highest value. \n",
    "- Hypergrid: Is a dictionary-like structure that specifies what values for each parameter to trial.\n",
    "- Callbacks: In this context, the callback is a special type of function called at the end of each epoch. In this example, we use 'EarlyStopping,' which is helpful for reducing computation time. With early stopping, once each additional epoch only improves the objective slightly, we conclude we have reached a point of diminishing return and finish the fitting process without completing every epoch.\n",
    "- Width: The number of units is a particular layer.\n",
    "- Depth: The number of layers in an ANN.\n",
    "- Validation split: By default, the tuner selects the model with the best value for the objective as calculated on training data. However, we can optionally specify a validation split size, whereby a random sample of training data will be withheld, and we select the best model as validated against that holdout data. This can be helpful in avoiding overfitting to training data.\n",
    "- Activation function: a function which each node in a layer uses to convert the inputted values into the outputted values. A sigmoid function would be appropriate for the activation function of an output node doing classification, while no function would be appropriate for a regression.

    "### Interpreting the model\n",
    "Most consumers of machine learning models want to know *why* a model gives the output it does. This can be a difficult task for a complex neural network, with many interactions nested in the algorithm. In a linear model, each feature has a positive or negative impact on the outcome. In an interactive model, the direction and size of effect is conditional and not so simple to describe. \n",
    "A common method for explaining why models output as they do is 'permutational feature importance' in which we calculate the loss of accuracy in a model when it does not have a given feature available. However, this is a lot of repeated computation when you have many features and ANNs can be slow for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is [SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which uses an algorithm based on game-theory as well as many computational optimizations, to efficiently calculate 'SHAP values' for an ANN. Here we shall demonstrate SHAP. A larger SHAP value indicates the feature is more influential. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This article provided a hand-on demonstration of how to implement ANNs for your own context. By following the code in this article, you should e able to adapt the reusable `ANNHypermodel` class to your own project. ANNs are a powerful machine learning algorithm, and can be applied to many different problems. With a basic understanding of how to implement ANNs, you can also start to progress to learn more advanced types of neural networks, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. \n",
